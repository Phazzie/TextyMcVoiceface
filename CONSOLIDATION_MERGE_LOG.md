This document records all actions, merges, and conflict resolutions performed during the consolidation of feature and fix branches into the `consolidation-merge` branch, prior to merging into `main`.

- Committed local WIP changes to allow branch switching.

### Merge Sequence

**REMAINING BRANCHES TO MERGE:**
- 🔄 `origin/feat/dialogue-power-balance-perspective-shift`
- 🔄 `origin/feat/unreliable-narrator-mode` ⚠️ **IN PROGRESS** - conflicts detected
- 🔄 `origin/feat/user-authentication`
- 🔄 `origin/feature/ai-actors-studio`
- 🔄 `origin/feature/bechdel-test-automator`
- 🔄 `origin/feature/color-palette-analyzer`
- 🔄 `origin/fix/report-refactor` ⏭️ **MOVED TO LAST** - architectural changes

---

### Strategic Change
**Decision:** Moved `origin/fix/report-refactor` to last position to minimize conflicts. The refactor contains major architectural changes (props→events) that would conflict with every remaining branch.

### Current Merge: `origin/feat/unreliable-narrator-mode`
**Status:** Conflicts detected in:
- `src/App.tsx`
- `src/services/SeamManager.ts` 
- `src/services/implementations/AIEnhancementService.ts`
- `src/types/contracts.ts`
