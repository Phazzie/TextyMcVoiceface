Th**MINIMAL MERGE STRATEGY:**
- ‚úÖ `origin/feat/user-authentication` **COMPLETED** ‚úÖ
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `origin/fix/report-refactor` **NEXT - FINAL**

**POSTPONED (optional features):**
- ‚è∏Ô∏è `origin/feat/dialogue-power-balance-perspective-shift`
- ‚è∏Ô∏è `origin/feat/unreliable-narrator-mode`  
- ‚è∏Ô∏è `origin/feature/ai-actors-studio`

**REASON:** Core functionality complete. Authentication is essential, report refactor improves architecture. Additional features can be added later without conflicts.records all actions, merges, and conflict resolutions performed during the consolidation of feature and fix branches into the `consolidation-merge` branch, prior to merging into `main`.

---

### Initial Steps
- Updated local `main` branch and created `consolidation-merge` from latest `main`.
- Committed local WIP changes to allow branch switching.

### Merge Sequence
- Merged the following branches (one by one):
  - `origin/feat/ai-actors-studio-ui` (no conflicts)
  - `origin/feat/ai-creative-partner-seam` (no conflicts)
  - `origin/feat/color-palette-display` (no conflicts)
  - `origin/feat/comprehensive-literary-device-scanner` (no conflicts)
- Committed local changes in `src/services/SeamManager.ts` and `src/tests/WritingQualityAnalyzer.test.ts` to allow further merges.
- Merged `origin/feat/dialogue-power-balance-perspective-shift` (conflicts detected):
  - Files with conflicts:
    - `src/components/WritingQualityReport.tsx`
    - `src/services/SeamManager.ts`
    - `src/services/implementations/WritingQualityAnalyzer.ts`
    - `src/types/contracts.ts`
- Resolved all conflicts by combining the most up-to-date and relevant changes from both branches, preserving all new features and types.
- Reviewed and validated the resolved files for correctness and feature completeness.
- Merged `origin/feat/echo-chamber-detector` (no conflicts)
