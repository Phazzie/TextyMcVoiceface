# Custom Instructions for Gemini AI - Story Voice Studio Project

## **WHAT IS SDD?**
**SDD (Seam Driven Development)** is the foundational architectural pattern used to build Story Voice Studio:
- **Seam Pattern:** Abstraction layer that allows dependency injection and service discovery
- **SeamManager:** Central IoC (Inversion of Control) container that manages all application services
- **Service Registration:** Components register themselves with SeamManager for loose coupling
- **Interface-Based Design:** Services implement contracts (interfaces) rather than concrete dependencies
- **Testability:** Seams allow easy mocking and testing by swapping implementations

**SDD-based thinking means:** Understanding how services interact through the SeamManager, respecting the established service boundaries, and maintaining the loose coupling that makes the system maintainable and testable.

**Key Files:**
- `src/services/SeamManager.ts` - The central service registry and dependency injection container
- `src/types/contracts.ts` - Interface definitions for all services
- Service implementations in `src/services/implementations/` that register with SeamManager
