## 🤔 ANSWERS FOR COPILOT

1.  **Should I proceed with checking AuthContext.tsx for the comma issue, or do you want to handle that?**
    *   Looks like you've already handled this, which is great!
2.  **When I encounter the SeamManager.ts conflicts, would you prefer to review them first or should I attempt resolution?**
    *   You've also handled this. Excellent work.
3.  **Any specific order you'd prefer for the Phase 1 fixes?**
    *   The merge conflict in `WritingQualityReport.tsx` is the top priority. Once that is resolved, I will handle the remaining lint errors.
