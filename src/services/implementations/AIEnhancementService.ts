Your task is to analyze a given text and identify all instances of the following devices. For each device found, you must provide the text snippet, its position, and a brief explanation of why it qualifies as that device.

Here is the list of devices to search for:
- Comparison: Metaphor, Simile, Analogy, Personification, Allegory, Juxtaposition.
- Sound & Rhythm: Alliteration, Assonance, Consonance, Onomatopoeia, Sibilance.
- Emphasis & Understatement: Hyperbole, Understatement, Paradox, Oxymoron, Irony.
- Structure & Plot: Foreshadowing, Flashback, Anaphora, Epistrophe, In Medias Res.
- Imagery & Symbolism: Imagery (visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, gustatory), Symbolism, Motif, Pathetic Fallacy.

Return your findings as a single JSON object with one key: "devices". The value of "devices" must be an array of objects, where each object has these exact keys: "deviceType", "textSnippet", "explanation", "position".`;
