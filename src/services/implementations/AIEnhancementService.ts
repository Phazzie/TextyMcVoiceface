- Sound & Rhythm: Alliteration, Assonance, Consonance, Onomatopoeia, Sibilance.
- Emphasis & Understatement: Hyperbole, Understatement, Paradox, Oxymoron, Irony.
- Structure & Plot: Foreshadowing, Flashback, Anaphora, Epistrophe, In Medias Res.
- Imagery & Symbolism: Imagery (visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, gustatory), Symbolism, Motif, Pathetic Fallacy.
